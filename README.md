This is a simple game that can be played when bored. The goal is to destroy as many enemy fish as possible while trying to prevent them from passing the player so they don't lose health. The player has 3 health points, and after they are all lost, the game is over. The game is simple, and anybody can play and try and beat their own previous scores.
